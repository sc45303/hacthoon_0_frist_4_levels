# Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0: Building Autonomous FTEs

## Tagline
Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop.

## Core Concept
Build a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent) - an AI agent that proactively manages personal and business affairs 24/7 using:
- **Brain:** Claude Code (reasoning engine)
- **Memory/GUI:** Obsidian (local Markdown dashboard)
- **Senses:** Python Watcher scripts (Gmail, WhatsApp, filesystem)
- **Hands:** MCP servers (external actions like sending emails)

## Key Innovation
The "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" - AI autonomously audits bank transactions and tasks to report revenue and bottlenecks, transforming AI from chatbot into proactive business partner.

## Architecture Principles
1. **Local-First:** Privacy-focused, data stays on your machine
2. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Approval workflow for sensitive actions
3. **Autonomous:** Watchers trigger AI, Ralph Wiggum loop keeps it working
4. **Extensible:** MCP servers for any external integration

## Tech Stack Requirements
- **Claude Code:** Primary reasoning engine (NOT Gemini, NOT ChatGPT)
- **Obsidian:** Knowledge base & dashboard (NOT plain markdown)
- **Python 3.13+:** Watcher scripts & orchestration
- **Node.js v24+:** MCP servers & automation
- **Agent Skills:** All AI functionality must be Agent Skills (NOT Python scripts)

## Participation Rules
- Individual participation
- All code must be original or properly attributed
- Must use Claude Code as primary reasoning engine
- Projects must include documentation and demo video

## Judging Criteria
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Functionality | 30% | Does it work? Are core features complete? |

## Submission Requirements
1. GitHub repository (public or private with judge access)
2. README.md with setup instructions and architecture overview
3. Demo video (5-10 minutes) showing key features
4. Security disclosure: How credentials are handled
5. Tier declaration: Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum
6. Submit Form: https://forms.gle/JR9T1SJq5rmQyGkGA

## Important Notes
1. **NOT a chatbot:** This is an autonomous agent that works 24/7
2. **NOT just automation:** This is intelligent reasoning + action
3. **NOT cloud-only:** Local-first for privacy (cloud optional in Platinum)
4. **NOT prompt engineering:** This is agent engineering

## Digital FTE Value Proposition
| Feature | Human FTE | Digital FTE |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Availability | 40 hours/week | 168 hours/week (24/7) |
| Monthly Cost | $4,000-$8,000+ | $500-$2,000 |
| Ramp-up Time | 3-6 months | Instant |
| Consistency | 85-95% accuracy | 99%+ consistency |
| Scaling | Linear | Exponential |
| Cost per Task | $3.00-$6.00 | $0.25-$0.50 |
| Annual Hours | ~2,000 hours | ~8,760 hours |

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** A Digital FTE works nearly 9,000 hours a year vs a human's 2,000. The cost per task reduction (from ~$5.00 to ~$0.50) is an 85-90% cost saving.
