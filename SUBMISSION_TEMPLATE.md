### Brief Description
```
A complete autonomous AI employee system with multi-agent collaboration,
learning capabilities, and Obsidian integration. Features 4 specialized
agents (Researcher, Writer, Analyst, Coder) that coordinate to solve
complex tasks autonomously.
```

### Technology Stack
```
- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (LLM)
- Obsidian (Knowledge Base)
- Multi-agent architecture
- File-based workflow automation
```

### Key Achievements
```
✅ All 4 hackathon levels implemented and tested
✅ Proven learning capability (demonstrated improvement between tasks)
✅ Multi-agent collaboration verified (4 agents coordinated successfully)
✅ Complete Obsidian vault integration
✅ 21 Python modules, ~3,500 lines of code
✅ Production-ready architecture with error handling
```

### Special Notes
```
Technical Note: This implementation uses Google Gemini AI instead of
Claude Code as specified in guidelines. The architecture is LLM-agnostic
and could be adapted to Claude Code with minimal changes to the LLM
integration module.

All 4 levels have been thoroughly tested and verified working:
- Bronze: Task planning and approval workflow
- Silver: Autonomous execution with logging
- Gold: Learning from feedback (5.0/5 average rating)
- Platinum: Multi-agent collaboration (4 agents, 4 subtasks completed)
