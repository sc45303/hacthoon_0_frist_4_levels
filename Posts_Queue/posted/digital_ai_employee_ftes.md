🤖 Introducing My Digital AI Employee - A Full-Time Assistant That Never Sleeps

I just built a complete AI-powered employee system that handles real work autonomously. Here's what it does:

📧 **Email Management**
• Monitors Gmail 24/7 (checks every 2 minutes)
• Automatically detects important emails
• Creates actionable tasks from messages
• Can send emails on command

🧠 **Intelligent Planning & Execution**
• AI analyzes tasks and creates execution plans
• Human-in-the-loop approval system
• Executes approved tasks autonomously
• Maintains detailed logs of all actions

🔗 **Social Media Automation**
• Auto-posts to LinkedIn on schedule
• Manages content queue
• Publishes while I sleep

💡 **How It Works**

The system has 4 levels:
🥉 Bronze: AI Planner (creates strategies)
🥈 Silver: AI Executor (takes action)
🥇 Gold: Gmail Integration (monitors inbox)
💎 Platinum: LinkedIn Integration (social presence)

**Real Example:**
1. Email arrives → System detects it
2. AI creates action plan → I approve
3. AI executes task → Logs everything
4. Task completed → Moved to archive

This is what a true "Digital FTE" looks like - an AI assistant that handles routine work, follows processes, and scales infinitely.

Built with: Gemini AI, Gmail API, LinkedIn API, Claude MCP
Stack: Python, Node.js, Cron automation

The future of work isn't replacing humans - it's augmenting them with AI that handles the repetitive stuff so we can focus on what matters.

What would you automate with your own Digital AI Employee?
