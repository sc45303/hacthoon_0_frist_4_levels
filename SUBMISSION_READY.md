## 🎤 Your Elevator Pitch (Memorize This)

"I built a Personal AI Employee that runs 24/7. It monitors my Gmail every 2 minutes, creates AI-powered action plans, executes tasks autonomously after approval, and posts to LinkedIn automatically.

It's not a demo - it's actually running right now. 41 real emails processed, 15 tasks completed, 2 LinkedIn posts published. All verifiable with logs and timestamps.

This is what a true Digital FTE looks like - an AI system that handles routine work so humans can focus on what matters."
