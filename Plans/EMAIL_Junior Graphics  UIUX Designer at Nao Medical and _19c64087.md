Here is a simple step-by-step plan:

1.  **Read the full email content:** Understand all job alerts mentioned in the Indeed email.
2.  **Evaluate job relevance:** Determine if any of the listed "Junior Graphics / UI/UX Designer" or "front end developer jobs" are of interest or require further action.
3.  **Take action on relevant jobs (if any):** This might involve clicking through to apply or saving the job details.
4.  **Forward if necessary:** If any job opportunities are more suitable for a colleague or contact, forward the email to them.
5.  **Archive the email:** Once all necessary actions have been taken, archive the email.
