Here is a simple step-by-step plan:

1.  **Acknowledge Email:** Confirm receipt and understanding of the Indeed job alert email.
2.  **Review Full Email Content:** Read the entire email to understand the details of the job opportunities from Digital Arcanum and Mercy Medical Equipment Supply.
3.  **Evaluate Job Relevancy:** Assess if the mentioned junior developer and front-end developer roles are relevant to current career goals or interests.
4.  **Determine Next Action (Reply/Forward/Apply):**
    *   If interested, identify the best way to proceed (e.g., click a link to apply, draft a reply if direct contact info is available, or forward to a relevant party if needed).
    *   If not interested, no further action beyond archiving is required.
5.  **Archive Email:** After determining and taking any necessary actions (or deciding no action is needed), archive the email to clear the inbox.
